# Py_Calculator_HW

This is a Python code that creates a Graphical User Interface (GUI) calculator using the PySimpleGUI library.

The calculator provides the basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and also modulo calculation.

The calculator also has an option to play the result of the calculation using the text-to-speech engine Pyttsx4.

## Functionality

The calculator provides the following functionality:

    Addition (+)
    Subtraction (-)
    Multiplication (*)
    Division (/)
    Modulo (%)
    Clear (C)
    Clear Entry (CE)
    Equals (=)
    Play (Play)

To perform a calculation, simply click the buttons for the numbers and operations you want to use. The result of the calculation will be displayed in the output area. If there is a syntax error, the output will show "Syntax error".

The "Clear" button clears the entire calculation, and the "Clear Entry" button deletes the last entered number or operation.

The "Play" button will read out the entire calculation using the text-to-speech engine Pyttsx4. The result of the calculation will also be read out.
